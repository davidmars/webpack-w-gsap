**Hainis Art Direction - Portfolio**

================================

Thanks for checking out my work.

Feel free to contact me anytime.
(3 am can be tricky but you never know...)

======================================================

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

**Development build works great.**

**Production build works great.**

Production build has Issues - UPDATE - ISSUES SOLVED:
1. The modal templates are dynamically loaded (this works great) BUT all of the hard/static coded src links in these templates are not processed. **- SOLVED - Thanks to Evan You & Thorsten LÃ¼nborg** by adding a ~ (tilde) to the front of the path name. This still raises issues - why webpack path aliases are not being honored in Vue template files? For example:

This path alias does not work:
`src="~assets/modalPrintAdvil1c.jpg"`

This relative path does not work:
`src="./assets/img/modalPrintAdvil1c.jpg"`

**This works:**
`src="~assets/img/modalPrintAdvil1c.jpg"`



2 - To solve programmatic link images not being processed in the modal-button.vue component the programmatic source path had to be called a different way
```
// template html
<img class="fadeMe" :src="getPic()" :alt="this.id + ' advertisment'">

//.vue

methods: {
			exampleSelected() {

				this.imageSrc = this.id;
				this.$emit('imageSelectChanged', this.imageSrc);
				console.log(this.imageSrc + " = this.imageSrc - modal button clicked");
			},

			getPic() {
			  return require('assets/img/' + this.id + '1a-sm.png');
		      return 'assets/img/' + this.id + '1a-sm.png';
		    },

		}, // END methods 

``` 

(Note: currently only the Print section has button thumbnail placeholders)


======================================================

**Note not all sections and modals have images**

Note only the following have images: 
- print/advil
- print/amex
- print/bayer
- Also, video, outdoor and online sections are blank.
- Work in progress...

======================================================

In the (not so) early stages of setting up:

**Webpack 2 config with various features, including:**
- Hot Module Reloading
- Image/Fonts/etc. Processing
- Path Aliases
- dev-server
- Vendor library code splitting
- etc. 


**Vue 2 project:**

GSAP Animation (only modal-slideshow has GSAP animations applied but not in a Vue way - using jquery):
- Tweenlite
- CSSPlugin
- ScrollToPlugin

Nav Buttons Component:
- Vue-Router with routes for Print, Video, Outdoor and Online.

Section Hero Image Component:
- Need to sort how to dynamically pass in the appropriate image data for each section (currently hard coded for Print Section)

Modal Buttons Component:
- Section thumbnails will call up a Modal Overlay (not accomplished by a sub-route - sub-routes may be a better way - need to research).
- Event Bus passes modal-button ID to modal-slideshow

Modal Slideshow Overlay Component:
- modal-slideshow listens for Event Bus change and loads about the appropriate Vue Modal file 
- NOTE still trying to sort how to use dynamic imports to solve having to create import statements for each individual modal and also having to register each individual modal component in the `export default`
